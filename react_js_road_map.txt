                               Advanced React.js Roadmap
                               -------------------------
1.  React Core Deep Dive
    React reconciliation and virtual DOM
    React rendering lifecycle
    Strict Mode and concurrent rendering
    Error boundaries



2.  Advanced Hooks
    Custom hooks (building and sharing logic)
    useReducer for complex state logic
    useCallback, useMemo for performance optimization
    useRef for mutable values and DOM access
    useLayoutEffect vs useEffect
    useImperativeHandle for exposing instance values


3.  Context and State Management
    React Context API (global state)
    Prop drilling vs. context
    Third-party state management:
    Redux Toolkit (modern Redux)
    Zustand, Jotai, Recoil, or MobX
    When to use local vs. global state


4.  React Router (Advanced Routing)
    Nested routes and layouts
    Route guards and authentication flows
    Dynamic routing and lazy loading routes


5.  Performance Optimization
    Memoization (React.memo, useMemo, useCallback)
    Code splitting with React.lazy and Suspense
    Windowing/virtualization (e.g., react-window, react-virtualized)
    Avoiding unnecessary re-renders
    Profiling with React DevTools


6.  Forms and Validation
    Controlled vs. uncontrolled components
    Libraries: Formik, React Hook Form, Yup for validation
    Dynamic forms and field arrays


7.  Testing
    Unit testing with Jest and React Testing Library
    Mocking API calls
    End-to-end (E2E) testing with Cypress or Playwright
    Test coverage and best practices


8.  TypeScript with React
    Typing props, state, and hooks
    Generics in components and hooks
    Type-safe context and reducers

9.  Server-Side Rendering (SSR) & Static Site Generation (SSG)
    Next.js framework (SSR, SSG, API routes)
    Data fetching strategies (getServerSideProps, getStaticProps)
    Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)

10. API Integration & Data Fetching
    SWR, React Query, TanStack Query for data fetching/caching
    WebSockets and real-time data
    GraphQL (Apollo Client, urql)
    
11. Authentication & Authorization
    JWT, OAuth, and session management
    Role-based access control (RBAC)
    Libraries: Auth0, Firebase Auth, Clerk, Supabase

12. Component Libraries & Design Systems
    Material-UI, Ant Design, Chakra UI, Tailwind CSS
    Building your own reusable component library
    Storybook for UI development and documentation

13. Accessibility (a11y)
    Semantic HTML and ARIA roles
    Keyboard navigation
    Screen reader support
    Tools: axe, Lighthouse

14. Internationalization (i18n)
    Libraries: react-i18next, FormatJS
    Dynamic language switching

15. Deployment & CI/CD
    Building and deploying with Vercel, Netlify, AWS, or Docker
    Environment variables and secrets management
    Automated testing and deployment pipelines (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI)

16. Monorepos & Large Scale Apps
    Monorepo tools: Turborepo, Nx, Lerna
    Micro-frontends
    Code splitting and lazy loading at scale

17. Staying Up-to-Date
    Follow React RFCs and the official blog
    Explore new features (e.g., React Server Components, React Compiler)
    Contribute to open source or join the React community




                      React.js Learning Roadmap
                      --------------------------
1. Prerequisites
   Basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (ES6+ features like arrow functions, destructuring, modules, etc.)


2. React Fundamentals
    What is React? Why use it?
    Components (Function vs. Class)
    JSX syntax

4.  Hooks
    useState
    useEffect (side effects, fetching data)
    Custom hooks (optional, advanced)

5. Component Communication
    Parent to child (props)
    Child to parent (callback functions)
    Sibling communication (lifting state up)

6. Forms in React
    Controlled components
